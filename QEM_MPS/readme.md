# Quantum Error Mitigation via Matrix Product Operator (MPO)

## Computer Implementation
See another folder named "Noisy quantum circuit simulator with MPDO".

## Physical Implementation
This project is mainly developed from paper,

*[1] Y. Guo and S. Yang, Quantum Error Mitigation via Matrix Product Operators, PRX Quantum 3, 040313 (2022).*

Paper introduced a new numerical method to mitigate the error in quantum circuit, whose 
key algorithm is to find inverse of the MPO, which was formed by the super-operator.
